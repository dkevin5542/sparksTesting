# GitHub Task Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks completed during my recent work with GitHub, including setting up SSH keys, creating branches, and forking repositories.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Set Up SSH Key
- Created a new SSH key specifically for this repository to enable secure cloning onto my local device.

### 2. Branch Creation
- Created a new branch called `my-new-branch` off the `main` branch.
- In this branch, I added two text files:
  - **`random.txt`**: An empty file.
  - **`question.txt`**: Contained two questions and one answer.

### 3. Merging Changes
- Merged the changes from `my-new-branch` back into the `main` branch.
- Committed the changes and pushed them to the remote repository.

### 4. Forking a Repository
- Forked a remote repository and cloned it onto my local device using SSH.
- Created a new branch called `feature` off the `main` branch of the forked repository.
- Added my name and email to the **`attendees.txt`** file in the `feature` branch.

### 5. Pushing Changes
- Pushed the changes made in the `feature` branch to my remote repository.

### 6. Pull Request
- Submitted a pull request to the original repository from which I forked.

### 7. Documentation
- Created this `README.md` file to summarize the tasks completed and pushed it to GitHub.

## Conclusion
This process enhanced my skills in GitHub management, including SSH key setup, branching, forking repositories, and managing pull requests.
